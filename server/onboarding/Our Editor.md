The heart of Outline is the document editor. We let you write in whichever way you prefer – be it Markdown, WYSIWYG, or taking advantage of the many keyboard shortcuts (Type `?` to see them all).

## Markdown

If you’re comfortable writing markdown then all of the shortcuts you are used to are supported, for example type \*\*bold\*\* to instantly create **bold** text. If you forget some syntax or are after a quick refresher hit the keyboard icon in the bottom right hand corner for our guide. Learning some of the key Markdown shortcuts will definitely make using Outline faster and more enjoyable!

You can also paste markdown, html, or rich text from elsewhere directly into a document.

## References

Linking to another document automatically creates backlinks which are kept up-to-date and shown at the bottom of the document, so you can create a library of linked information and easily answer the question "which other documents link here?".

## Rich documents

The editor supports a variety of content blocks including images, tables, lists, quotes, task lists, videos, and more. Type `/` on an empty line or click on the `+` icon to trigger the block insert menu, you can keep typing to filter it down. Of course, you can also drag and drop images to include them in your document or paste a link to embed content from one of the many supported [integrations](https://www.getoutline.com/integrations)
