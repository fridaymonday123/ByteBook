## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Outline team takes security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

If you discover a security vulnerability in outline, please disclose it via [GitHub](https://github.com/outline/outline/security/advisories/new). The Outline maintainers will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report you will be kept informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement.

Report security bugs in third-party dependencies to the person or team maintaining the module. You can also report a vulnerability through the [Node Security Project](https://nodesecurity.io/report).
